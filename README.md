## üóÇÔ∏è Assignments Overview

| **Program**                  | **Description**                                                                                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Program 1: Binary Search** | Use binary search to find query numbers in a sorted array, returning their indices or "Not Found" |
| **Program 2: Merge Sort**    | Implement merge sort to sort list of integers and print the sorted output along with the total count.|
| **Program 3: Heap Sort**     | Implement heap sort to sort numbers, comparing its runtime with merge sort for one million and ten million numbers. |
| **Program 4: Binary Search Tree** | Implement a binary search tree to insert and delete integers, then print the remaining tree contents and their depths|
| **Program 5: Breadth First Search** | Implement BFS on a directed graph to determine the number of edges between a specified start and end vertex |
| **Program 6: Dijkstra's Algorithm** | Implement Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between two vertices in a direct graph using a priority queue |
| **Program 7: Prim's Algorithm** | Implement Prim's Algorithm to calculate the cost of a minimum spanning tree from an undefined graph based on given input files.|
| **Program 8: Longest Common Substring** | Determine the length of a longest common subsequence and print out the length, followed by the letters in the common subsequence.|
